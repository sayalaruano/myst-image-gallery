# Image Gallery

This is an example of the **MyST Python executable plugin** to create a image gallery. This project was inspired by the [cookbook gallery](https://github.com/projectpythia-mystmd/cookbook-gallery) from the [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia-mystmd.github.io/). 

Bellow we present a gallery of images created by [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.co.uk/) for The [Turing Way Community](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way), which were shared under a CC-BY licence. All these images can be found at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13882307).
